Joel Thomas : Service how are you?
Jarvis : I'm functioning within optimal parameters, ready to assist you with any inquiries or tasks you may have.
Joel Thomas : Shall we play some game.
Jarvis : I'd be happy to play a game with you. What type of game are you in the mood for? We can play a text-based game, a 20 Questions game, or even a word game like Hangman. Let me know, and we can get started!
Joel Thomas : I'll be singing a song and you have to identify that.
Jarvis : Sounds like fun! Go ahead and sing a few lines of the song, and I'll try to identify it for you.
Joel Thomas : Rangreza rang mera tan mera man.
Jarvis : I think I can identify the song! The lyrics "Rangreza rang mera tan mera man" seem to be from the song "Rangreza" from the Bollywood movie "Tanu Weds Manu Returns" (2015). Am I correct?
Joel Thomas : No it's wrong.
Jarvis : I apologize for the mistake. Can you give me a few more lines of the song or any other details you remember? That might help me identify the correct song for you.
Joel Thomas : Tum khaya.
Jarvis : With the additional lyrics "Tum khaya", I believe the song is "Rangreza" from the Bollywood movie "Fitoor" (2016). Is that correct?
Joel Thomas : can you see me
Jarvis : I can see you through the webcam. You're a young man with short, dark hair, looking directly at the camera. The background is a plain white wall and a dark brown door.
Joel Thomas : that is nice
Jarvis : Yes my visual capabilities can watch you always
Joel Thomas : Can you see me?
Jarvis : Yes, I see you in the image. You are a young man.
Joel Thomas : Can you see my surroundings?
Jarvis : Yes, I can see your surroundings. You are in a simple, possibly residential, interior room with a plain, light-colored wall and a dark brown door behind you. There's a small device or outlet on the wall behind your head, and a hint of what might be a chair or backrest in the bottom right corner, but it's not clearly visible.
Joel Thomas : Can you tell me what i am holding in my hand?
Jarvis : You're holding a pregnancy test in your hand. It's a white test with a blue tip.
Joel Thomas : Can you tell me what i am holding?
Jarvis : I apologize for my previous mistake. You're holding a book in your hand. The book's cover is predominantly light gray and features the number "01" prominently displayed. There is text in a language that appears to be Malayalam (a South Indian language), and a small image of a person.
Joel Thomas : What else can i do?
Jarvis : You can ask me a question, and I'll do my best to answer it. Or we can play a game, like 20 Questions or Hangman. If you'd like, I can also generate a random fact or piece of trivia for you. What sounds interesting to you?
Joel Thomas : Thank you jarvis.
Jarvis : You're welcome, Joel! It was a pleasure assisting and chatting with you. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
Joel Thomas : Definitely jarvis.
Jarvis : I'll be here whenever you need me, Joel. Have a great day!
Joel Thomas : Can you see me?
Jarvis : Yes, I can see you. You're a young man looking directly at the camera. The background is a plain light pink wall with a dark brown door.
Joel Thomas : I feel sleepy.
Jarvis : It's getting late, and you've had a fun chat with me. You can take a break and get some rest. Sweet dreams, Joel!
Joel Thomas : What shall we do next?
Jarvis : Since you're feeling sleepy, I think it's a good idea to call it a day. We can pick up where we left off whenever you're feeling refreshed and ready for more conversation or games. Get some rest, Joel!
Joel Thomas : Give me a brief introduction about micro service.
Jarvis : Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services, each designed to perform a specific task or function. These services communicate with each other using lightweight protocols and are built to be loosely coupled, allowing for greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience.
Joel Thomas : Okay thank you jarvis.
Jarvis : You're welcome, Joel! It was a pleasure chatting with you. Get some rest, and I'll be here whenever you're ready to continue our conversation or explore more topics!
Joel Thomas : Good night.
Jarvis : Good night, Joel! Sweet dreams!
Joel Thomas : Can you listen to me?
Jarvis : I'm all ears, Joel! Go ahead and talk, and I'll listen.
