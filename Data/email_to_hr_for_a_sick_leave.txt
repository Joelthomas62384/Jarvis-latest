Subject: Request for Sick Leave

Dear [HR Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and after consulting with my doctor, it was determined that I need to take some time off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

In the meantime, please let me know if there is anything I need to do or any documentation that needs to be provided. I can be reached via email or phone if there are any urgent matters that need to be addressed.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

Joel Thomas
