Dear [Employer's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am in need of a sick leave. I have been experiencing some health issues and my doctor has advised me to take a few days off to rest and recover.

I understand that taking time off can be inconvenient, but I assure you that I will do my best to make up for the lost time as soon as I am back to work. I will be monitoring my condition and will keep you updated on my progress.

I am grateful for your understanding and support during this difficult time. If there is anything I can do to make this transition smoother, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
