Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to request an extension for the deadline of [project/assignment name]. I understand that the original deadline was set for [original deadline], however, due to unforeseen circumstances, I am unable to meet this deadline.

I have been working diligently on this project/assignment, but I have encountered some unexpected challenges that have caused me to fall behind schedule. I am confident that with a little more time, I will be able to complete the project/assignment to the best of my abilities and meet the high standards that are expected of me.

I would like to request an extension of [number of days/weeks] to complete the project/assignment. I am committed to delivering quality work and I believe that with this extension, I will be able to do just that.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I am willing to discuss any alternative arrangements that may be necessary. I appreciate your understanding and consideration in this matter.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Joel Thomas
